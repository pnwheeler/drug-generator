I'm obsessed with words like "skyrizi", "sotyktu", and ["lupron depot-ped"](https://www.abbvie.com/patients/products.html#lupron_depot-ped). I thought it'd be fun to see if I could make some of my own and trained an RNN on the names of currently(as of April 2023) available drugs on the market

I'd wanted to convert it to tensorflowjs to make a little web app to run inference on the browser, but porting isn't exactly strightforward and this is sort of a joke. Anyways, it was fun and I learned some stuff
